Create a new project
File -> new -> Project -> Maven -> groupId -> artifactId -> click create

group id - it means the name of the organisation
artifact id - it means the name of the project


we created maven project -
pom.xml file is the configuration file where we will add all the dependencies
pom.xml is the file we will use to execute our code in the end of the framework
pom.xml is the file we will use to generate the report

in our project we get src folder in which we get main and test

main - the code we write to develop the application, we write it in main
test - the code we write to test the application, we write it in test

we delete main folder because we will work with test

in test folder -
we get java - to keep all the java stuff
we get resources - to keep all the non java stuff
